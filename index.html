      <p>
        I’m building a space where creativity meets curiosity—sharing projects,ideas, and experiments as I learn and grow. 
        Media is my way of understanding the way people connect through digital communication. 
        I am interested in how apps and tools change the way we learn and share. 
        I love using these spaces to create content. 
        Through media, I want to learn the skills needed for my creativity and stay ahead of the digital world.
